# data_structures_and_algorithms
This repo is geared towards learning about the comp sci/ software dev area for a person who's not from that area. It will be broken into two folders..yup you guessed it...data structures and algorithms.  Additionally there will be detailed examples, links and others to examples and practice exercises. (e.g. Leetcode, hackerrank, etc.)
